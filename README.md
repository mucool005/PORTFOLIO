## ‚úèÔ∏è How to Customize

This portfolio is designed to be easily customized.

1.  **Update Content:** Open `index.html` and edit the text in the Hero, Expertise, Skills, and Education sections to reflect your own information.
2.  **Change Avatar:** In `index.html`, replace the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag in the Hero section with a link to your own image or avatar.
    ```html
    <!-- Found in the Hero section -->
    <img src="your-image-url.jpg" alt="Your Name" class="hero-image" />
    ```
3.  **Modify Styles:** Open `style.css` to change the color scheme, fonts, or other custom styles. The primary accent color can be easily changed by updating the `--primary-color` variable at the top of the file.
    ```css
    :root {
      --primary-color: #0050ff; /* Change this value to a new color */
      /* ... other variables */
    }
    ```
